### Project Title
Explore US Bike Share Data

### Description
This project uses python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The user of the program gets an interactive experience in the terminal and can choose the city he wants to explore and some additional filter such as the month and the day of the week. Optionally some raw data of the filtered data is shown and afterwards some selected statistics of the data will be shown.
The user can decide, if he wants to start again and select a new city and filters, after he got all the statistics.
